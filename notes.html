The doubler append scales better because it's time decreases as the array grows in length. Using the push method adds to the end of the array which takes up less memory than using unshift which has to shift the position of each item in the array. For larger arrays the push method is the better solution however as seen in the tests, for small arrays the unshift method is faster.
